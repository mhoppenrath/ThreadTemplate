            I need you to answer in the affirmative to the questions below before I can clear you for dispatch. If you disagree with this question for any reason or have any questions/concerns please call me or your recruiter right away.<br>
            Do you understand you are being cleared for dispatch as an independent contractor, and as an independent contractor you are responsible for ALL expenses - including, but not limited to - fuel, transportation to and from trucks, occupational/accidental insurance and a $1,500 security deposit? Have all of your questions regarding this information been answered prior to being cleared for dispatch?

            This email is to confirm the DOT  Pre-Qualification Drug Screen that was recently scheduled with TruckMovers. The clinic information is listed below. This email is NOT the authorization; that will be faxed to the clinic separately. If you get to the clinic, and they do not have the authorization, please contact Kathy Shanks at 816-994-0601.<br><br>
            Please note as an Independent Contractor you are responsible for the cost of the drug screen. Therefore, TruckMovers will be deducting $48 from your security deposit to cover this charge.<br><br>
            Also, if for any reason you can not make it to your scheduled appointment, please give me a call and we will notify the clinic and reschedule.<br><br><br>

At that time, one of the members of our department will call you to complete the process.<br>
